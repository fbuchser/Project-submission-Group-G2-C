This repository includes the file structure, code and report for the Foundations of Data Science project of Group G2-C.

The group members of G2-C were:
- Frank Julia
- Sch√§r Sabine
- Nagendran Varsa
- Buchser Fabienne

Our data set was:
- Project 2: GBM-UPENN

We recommend the following running order:
- 01_Data Understanding (Radiological Features).ipynb
- 02_Data Preprocessing.py
- 03_1_Random Forest Classifier.py
- 03_2_XGBoost Classifier.py
- 03_3_Support Vector Machine.py
- 03_4_Logistic Regression.py
- 04_Summary Results.py

Seperately on a server like stated in the document itself:
- 02_Data Preprocessing 11-Imputations.ipynb

BUT all files should run as it is now individually and without limitations, since we include our own output files in the submission.
If you do not want to this delete all files in the Output folder (BUT NOT the subfolders) and generate each necessary output yourself.
(ALSO do not delete the Imputation files in ".\Output\Data\02 11-Imputations" since the imputation takes considerable resources to run until the end - there are notes in the code files)
